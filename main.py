Creating a comprehensive tool for optimizing energy consumption in smart homes involves several components: collecting real-time data, analyzing it using predictive analytics, and providing actionable insights or controls. Below is a simplified version of such a program, focusing on structuring and organizing the concepts. This example will illustrate the basic workflow and ideas, but a real-world implementation would require more sophisticated models and data sources.

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Simulate real-time energy consumption data for various appliances
class Appliance:
    def __init__(self, name, baseline_usage):
        self.name = name
        self.baseline_usage = baseline_usage  # watts
        self.current_usage = baseline_usage

    def simulate_usage(self):
        # Simulate real-time fluctuations in energy consumption
        self.current_usage = self.baseline_usage * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
        return self.current_usage

# Error handling for data input
def get_hourly_energy_data(appliances, hours=24):
    try:
        hourly_data = []
        for hour in range(hours):
            current_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=hour)
            usage_data = {app.name: app.simulate_usage() for app in appliances}
            hourly_data.append((current_time, usage_data))
        return hourly_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error collecting energy data: {e}")
        return None

# A mock predictive model for optimizing energy usage
def predict_optimal_usage(hourly_data, target_reduction=0.1):
    try:
        predicted_savings = {}
        for time, usage_data in hourly_data:
            total_usage = sum(usage_data.values())
            optimal_usage = total_usage * (1 - target_reduction)
            predicted_savings[time] = {'current_usage': total_usage, 'optimal_usage': optimal_usage}
        return predicted_savings
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in predictive analytics: {e}")
        return None

# Simulate the adaptation of smart home devices to optimize energy
def adapt_energy_usage(predicted_savings):
    try:
        for time, savings in predicted_savings.items():
            print(f"At {time}, current usage: {savings['current_usage']}W, optimal usage: {savings['optimal_usage']}W")
            print(f"Adjusting appliances to meet optimal usage.")
            # Logic to integrate with smart home devices could go here
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during adaptation phase: {e}")

def main():
    # Initialize appliances
    try:
        appliances = [
            Appliance('HVAC', 3500),
            Appliance('Refrigerator', 200),
            Appliance('Washer', 500),
            Appliance('Dryer', 1800),
            Appliance('Lighting', 400)
        ]
        
        # Collect real-time energy data
        hourly_data = get_hourly_energy_data(appliances)
        if hourly_data is None:
            return
        
        # Predict optimal energy usage
        predicted_savings = predict_optimal_usage(hourly_data)
        if predicted_savings is None:
            return
        
        # Adapt to optimal usage based on predictions
        adapt_energy_usage(predicted_savings)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to execute energy optimization: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Components of the Program:

- **Simulating Real-Time Data**: The `Appliance` class simulates energy usage data. In a real-world scenario, you would connect to actual smart home devices or use IoT APIs to get this data.
  
- **Error Handling**: Throughout the script, there are try-except blocks to handle potential errors that might occur during data collection, predictive modeling, or adapting energy usage.

- **Predictive Analytics**: A mock predictive function is used to estimate optimal energy consumption. In practice, machine learning models or more complex statistical methods would be used.

- **Adaptation**: The script contains a placeholder for adjusting energy usage. A real application might interface with smart home systems to modify appliance settings.

This script is a basic framework and would need further development to tackle real-world requirements, such as using actual data sources, implementing sophisticated predictive models, and interfacing with smart home devices for real-time control.
